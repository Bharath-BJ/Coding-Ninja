/* Space complexity is nothing but the amount of memory space that an algorithm
 * or a problem takes during the execution of that particular problem/algo.
 * 
 * The space complexity is not only calculated by the space used by the variables 
 * in the problem/algo it also includes and considers the space for input values with it.
 * Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Space used for input values
 * 
 * Points to remember while measuring Big O notation for space complexity
 * 1. Space complexity is max space required at any point of time it's not total space required for algorithm
 * 2. Recursion takes space just like functions stored in stack (consider max function in stack)
